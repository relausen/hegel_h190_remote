# Python(ista) based remote prototype for Hegel H190

Requires Pythonista, the fantastic Python IDE for iOS. Only tested in Pythonista 3.2 with Python 3.6.

I can't stress it enough: This is a prototype, purely created for my own learning purposes.

GUI is ... let's say ... basic. Purely for having something to tap on ðŸ™‚. If you want to make it pretty, please make a fork and send me a pull request. Alternatively, send me a mockup in, e.g., PNG format and I'll give it a go. This might encourage me to bring this further than prototype level.

Error handling is also almost non-existent. This may improve in the near future, in case I decide to make this more than a prototype.

On the technical side: For convenience, I just use the Telnet library to talk to the amplifier. It is probably overkill, but ever so simple to work with. I have planned to teach myself socket programming in Python, so stay tuned - it might very well be this project I use for that.
