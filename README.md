# Python(ista) based remote prototype for Hegel H190

Requires Pythonista, the fantastic Python IDE for iOS. Only tested in Pythonista 3.2 with Python 3.6.

I can't stress it enough: This is a prototype, purely created for my own learning purposes. Therefore you will find, e.g., different ways of playing with how to interact with the UI, trying out Python thingies etc. etc.

GUI is ... let's say ... basic. Purely for having something to tap on ðŸ™‚. If you want to make it pretty, please make a fork and send me a pull request. Alternatively, send me a mockup in, e.g., PNG format and I'll give it a go. This might encourage me to bring this further than prototype level.

Error handling is also almost non-existent. This may improve in the near future, in case I decide to make this more than a prototype.
